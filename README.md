# A Chrome Extention friend to help you! 🥰 👾 

IIIT-A Click n Connect is a **Chrome Extension**.

It is a great way of helping out students for managing their resources according to their interests as the extension saves your record and browses your topics of interests.Also, with so many societies and so many resources it can become overwhelming to keep a track of what's going on thus it is also a one click to connect to several events, articles, and video streams being conducted by IIITA.

# Special Feature: Timer! ⏰ 
This extension has a break-timer setter. 

After a long duration of studing continuously, a person wants to take a break, but, many times he/she stay into that break for a long time. Like if he wants to watch some youtube videos in break then he keeps on watching it. This extension has a timer in which you can set time for your break and after that time, the tabs will be shut down automatically.
